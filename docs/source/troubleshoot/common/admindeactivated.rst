My administrator account is deactivated
=======================================

Normally an administrator can reactivate deactivated user accounts in 
:doc:`Settings > All Accounts </userguide/settings/allaccounts>`. However, that's not
possible if the administrator's account has been deactivated. Manually reactivate an administrator's ThinkUp account
by setting the is_activated field equal to 1 in the ThinkUp installation's owners table.
