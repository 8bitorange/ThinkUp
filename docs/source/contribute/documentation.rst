Documentation Writers
======================

**Help Wanted!** Currently we are porting ThinkUp's documentation from the `GitHub wiki 
<https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki>`_ into the main repository. Please help with this tedious and 
time-consuming effort.

Not only does the ThinkUp community want to create a great software platform, we want to make it accessible to everyone
with clear and thorough documentation. You're reading the very beginning of that effort, but we've got
a lot of work to do.

If you're a ThinkUp user and know how to write clear descriptions and tutorials on technical topics, we need your help.

How to Contribute Documentation
-------------------------------

This documentation is generated by a tool called `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.  We write documentation in 
plain text files using a format called reStructuredText. We store those source files in `ThinkUp source code
repository's docs folder <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/tree/master/docs/source>`_. 

To contribute new documentation, `fork ThinkUp's source code and issue a pull request for your changes 
<https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki/Developer-Guide%3A-Get-the-Source-Code-from-GitHub-and-Keep-It-Updated>`_.

Alternately, to edit an existing page, fork the ThinkUp repository, navigate to that documentation's source file, and
click on the edit link. Make your change, and then send a pull request for the update.

Currently we're working on ways to make contributing documentation easier. :doc:`Get in touch </contact>` with your
ideas.

.. seealso::
    The `reStructuredText primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ is a good referene while you write rST. Also,
    this `reStructuredText online editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_ lets you preview your work live on the web.
