ThinkUp User Accounts
=====================

To use ThinkUp, you must create a ThinkUp user account either during application installation or using the registration
form. 

Registration and Account Activation
-----------------------------------

During the installation process, ThinkUp creates an initial, deactivated administrator account. To activate this account
and log in, you must click on the activation link in the email notification generated by the installer.

To register for a new user account, in ThinkUp's status bar click on Login, then click on Register. If the
installation administrator :doc:`has opened registration to new users </userguide/settings/application>`, you may 
fill out the form to create a new user account.

.. warning::
    If your web host is unable to send email via `PHP's mail function <http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php>`_, 
    you won't receive the initial account activation email, and  neither will any users who register on your
    installation. Therefore, you must manuallly activate the initial administrator account by setting the
    is_activated field equal to 1 in ThinkUp's owners table. Once the administrator account is activated, the admin
    may activate user accounts in :doc:`Settings > All Accounts </userguide/settings/allaccounts>`.

If the installation administrator has not opened registration to new users, when you click on the Register link, you
will see the :doc:`Sorry, registration is closed on this ThinkUp installation </troubleshoot/messages/regclosed>`
message.

Login and Lockout
-----------------

You can only log into ThinkUp if you provide the correct email address and password, and your user account is activated.

To prevent brute force attacks which attempt to guess a user's ThinkUp password, ThinkUp enforces a failed login
attempt cap. After 10 failed login attempts, ThinkUp deactivates the user account. An administrator must reactivate
it.

.. hint::
    If the administrator's ThinkUp account has been deactivated due to failed login attempts, the administrator can
    reactivate it by manually setting the is_activated field equal to 1 in the installation's owners table.

If you've forgotten your ThinkUp password, on the Login page, click on "Forgot password." Enter the email address
associated with your user account, and ThinkUp will email you a password reset message.

User Permissions
----------------

Currently there are two levels of user permissions in ThinkUp: user-level and administrator-level permissions.

* **Users** cannot enable, disable, or configure plugins, or see a list of users for a given ThinkUp installation.
* **Administrators** can enable, disable, and configure plugins, see a list of users on a given ThinkUp installation, see all the views for social media accounts registered on the installation, deactivate ThinkUp user accounts, and configure global application settings like whether or not registration is open to new users.

Every ThinkUp installation must have at least one administrator account. A ThinkUp installation can have any 
number of user or administrator accounts.

User Accounts versus Service Instances
--------------------------------------


There are two types of users in ThinkUp: user accounts and service instances (like  a Twitter or Facebook user). 
   
A ThinkUp user can have any number of service instances associated with it. For example, ThinkUp user 
aplusk@example.com could be a ThinkUp user account with both aplusk and mrskutcher on Twitter as well as the
Ashton Kutcher Facebook page associated with it.
