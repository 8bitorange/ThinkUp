Update Your Data
================

Once you've set up service users like your Twitter or Facebook account, you want to start capturing data from those
networks. Here's how.

Manually in Your Browser
------------------------

The simplest (and most manualy) way to update your data is to click on the "Update now" link on the left side of
ThinkUp's status bar. This will run ThinkUp's data crawler and show you its activity as it runs right in your web
browser. Once you've begun a manual update on this page, keep your browser tab open until it's complete. Then, go
to your ThinkUp dashboard to see the data ThinkUp has collected.

Once you've determined that ThinkUp's crawler is successfully capturing your data, set up an automatic update schedule
using either RSS or cron. Find the instructions on how at the bottom of the web-based crawler page.
