I've tweeted more than 3,200 times. Will ThinkUp archive my oldest tweets?
==========================================================================

No. While ThinkUp does everything it can to go back and capture historical data, it is subject to API limitations of
the services it crawls.

In Twitter's case, it's not currently possible for ThinkUp to access any tweets past the last 3,200 in your history.
