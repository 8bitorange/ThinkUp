h1. ThinkTank

All code submitted to the repository should have working tests.

The test suite assumes there is a <code>thinktank_tests</code> database which the default ThinkTank db user can access. Each test should set up the appropriate test data in the setUp() method and drop those tables in the tearDown() method.

Once your tests work, add them to the <code>all_tests.php</code> file to run along with the existing tests.
