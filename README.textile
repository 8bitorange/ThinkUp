h1. Twitalytic

Twitter data crawler, replies archiver, and statistics generator.


h2. WARNING: Pre-alpha code, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is not production code. This pre-alpha Twitter client stores your Twitter account usernames and passwords in your own database (hashed, not encrypted), which Twitter "strongly recommends against":http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Security-Best-Practices#PasswordRetention. The webapp's own login is also not as secure as it should be. This code is for experimentation and tinkering only. Do not run on a public, production server. You have been warned.
