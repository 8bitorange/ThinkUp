h1. ThinkTank

Capture and organize replies to status updates on Twitter (and beyond).


h2. WARNING: Pre-alpha code, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is not production code. This is a pre-alpha web application. The intended audience is server administrators with experience installing and troubleshooting PHP/MySQL hosted web applications. While ThinkTank uses OAuth to access Twitter, the webapp's login is not as secure as it should be. Right now this code is for experimentation and tinkering only. Do not run on a public, production server. You have been warned.


h2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

* "PHP 5":http://php.net with cURL and GD enabled
* "Smarty":http://smarty.net
* "MySQL 5":http://mysql.com/


h2. INSTALL

In future versions, this will get easier.

h3. Install application files

* Download source code. Save it one level below your web site's DocumentRoot. (That is, if your site's DocumentRoot is <code>/var/www/vhosts/example.com/httpdocs/</code>, save ThinkTank files in <code>/var/www/vhosts/example.com/thinktank/<code> folder.
* Create a symbolic link to the <code>thinktank/webapp</code> directory in your site's DocumentRoot folder. To do so, <code>cd</code> to the DocumentRoot, and use <code>ln -s ../thinktank/webapp/ thinktank</code> command.
* Make the <code>thinktank/webapp/templates_c/</code> and <code>thinktank/webapp/templates_c/cache/</code> directories writable by the web server.
* *Note for upgraders:* If you're upgrading a previous installation, delete your cookies (in Firefox under Preferences / Privacy / delete individual cookies).

h3. Set up database

* Create a database and select it, i.e., CREATE DATABASE thinktank
* Build tables with <code>build-db.sql</code>

h3. Register your app with Twitter (for OAuth support)

* Log into Twitter and "register your ThinkTank instance":http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/. Set the callback URL to 
<code>http://yourserver.com/path-to-thinktank-webapp/account/oauth.php</code> 
Write down the items labeled "Consumer key" and "Consumer secret."

h3. Configure the app

* *Shared libraries*: Rename <code>thinktank/common/config.sample.inc.php</code> to <code>config.inc.php</code>. Add your database credentials, file and webapp paths, and the key/secret you got from Twitter in the previous step.
* *Crawler*: Rename <code>thinktank/crawler/config.crawler.sample.inc.php</code> to <code>config.crawler.inc.php</code> and set include path to the absolute location of <code>thintank/common</code>
* *Webapp*: Rename <code>thinktank/webapp/config.webapp.sample.inc.php</code> to <code>config.webapp.inc.php</code> and set include path to the absolute location of <code>thinktank/common</code>


h2. RUN

Visit the web application on your server, register/login, and set up your Twitter accounts.

Then, run the crawler to load your Twitter data:

<code>$ php crawler/crawl.php</code>

To view what's going on with the crawler, use this command:

<code>$ tail -f crawler/logs/crawler.log</code>

Cron the crawler's run command to go at least once an hour.
